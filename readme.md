# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks detailing a wide range of machine learning algorithms. Each notebook provides an in-depth exploration of an algorithm, from its mathematical foundations to its practical implementations and use cases.

I made this repo as a consulting reference and cheat-sheet.

## Table of Contents

1. **Supervised Learning**

   - [Linear Regression](./notebooks/linear_regression.ipynb)
   - [Logistic Regression](./notebooks/logistic_regression.ipynb)
   - [Decision Trees](./notebooks/decision_trees.ipynb)
   - ... (continue for other algorithms)

2. **Unsupervised Learning**

   - [K-Means](./notebooks/k_means.ipynb)
   - ... (continue for other algorithms)

3. **Semi-supervised and Transfer Learning**

   - [Self-training](./notebooks/self_training.ipynb)
